# Image-and-Audio-Processing - MATLAB

## Overview:
This MATLAB project was developed as part of the Signals course at the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University. The project focuses on implementing various image processing techniques such as edge detection, blurring, motion blurring, sharpening, and image restoration. Additionally, it includes functionality for audio sampling and transmitting.

## Features:
1. **Image Processing Features:**
    - **Edge Detection:** Detects edges in images using the Laplacian kernel.
    - **Blurring:** Applies blurring filters.
    - **Motion Blurring:** Simulates motion blur effects in images caused by camera or object motion.
    - **Sharpening:** Enhances image details and edges.
    - **Image Restoration:** Restoring the motion blurred imaged using inverse fourier transform.

2. **Audio Sampling and Transmitting:**
    - Implements audio sampling techniques to digitize analog audio signals.
    - Transmits audio signals using modulation techniques like Amplitude Modulation (AM).
